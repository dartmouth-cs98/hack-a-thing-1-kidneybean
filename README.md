README for Kyra and Sydni's Hack-a-Thing-1 Web Scraper! 

Tutorial followed from https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-scrape-websites-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-5946935d93fe

We built a web scraper that ranks Wikipedia websites by the number of links using the Beautiful Soup library. We also calculate the average number of links in the set of scraped pages. 

This was a really cool project! We learned the basics of scraping, which we think could be potentially useful in our final project.
